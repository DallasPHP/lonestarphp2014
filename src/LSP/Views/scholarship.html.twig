            <h2 class="h-section">Lone Star PHP 2014 Scholarship</h2>
            
            <p>
                The PHP community over the past 4 years have turned Lone Star PHP into one of the most successful community run conferences, 
                and we want to give back! This year, Lone Star PHP is offering 2 scholarships to developers to attend our conference and 
                connect with their peers and mentors. While this scholarship specifically encourages students, women, minorities, and other 
                under-represented groups to apply applications are open to anyone.
            </p>

            <p>
                Scholarship recipients will be partnered with a guide (whom we will affectionately refer to as sherpas). These guides will 
                be experienced developers who have attended several conferences and will act as ambassadors and mentors to the scholars, 
                helping them meet their peers, connect with our speakers, hone their craft, and make lifelong friends in the community.
            </p>
